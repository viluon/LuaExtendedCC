# What is this?
LuaExtendedCC is a syntax definition and snippet package for Sublime Text 3. It is really an adaptation of [LuaExtended](https://github.com/viluon/LuaExtended), customised to suit [ComputerCraft](http://computercraft.info). Everything that applies to the original package is also true for LECC, except for completions (which are present only for [libraries and functions available](http://www.computercraft.info/wiki/Category:APIs) in [ComputerCraft](http://computercraft.info)) and the package-wide scope, which is `luaecc`, not `luae`.
